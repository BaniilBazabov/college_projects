1) In order to run, you have to open two separate terminals, one in frontend directory, one in backend.
2) For both you may use "npm start"
3) I've only managed to get the "Post" method implemented with the front end, although the code is written for all methods in the backend, I left the code for it in the front end but it doesn't work. (the table part)
4) For some reason, in the create sections, selection boxes must be changed since default values wont let you submit. (unless you deselect and select them again)
